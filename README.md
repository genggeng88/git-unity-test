# git-unity-test
A simple test for git unity game development<br>

I used SourceTree as GUI of Git (Github Desktop should also work fine).<br>

Step for pushing Unity files into Github:<br>
1. Create a Github Repository (add a read me file, add .gitignore (Unity))<br>
2. In SourceTree or Github Desktop, clone a git repository (input the git repo clone link, the folder where the repo should be placed, and the name of the project)<br>
3. Create a Unity project (put Unity project in the same folder of your repo)<br>
4. Back to SourceTree, Unity files should have appeared in your file status<br>
5. Stage all added files, commit, push<br>
6. Now, all Unity files are stored in your remote git repo.<br>
